**`Software Developer Java, Spring, Flutter`**

I am Mothusi a full-stack developer and content creator on programming. I focus on creating content on Java technology. My video contents are not created the same way. I sometimes do not plan to create videos. I like to make my videos where I do slides presentations followed by practical demos. I sometimes host other developers to have practical coding sessions. I publish my content o my YouTube channel "[JavaSpace]"
